HAPPY HOLIDAYS EVERYONE! This month's optional www.onegameamonth.com 250xp theme-word challenge is: QUEST-GIVER.

Who doesn't love finding one in any game? It's the most welcome of all NPCs. Somebody who needs our help! Whether they need us to defeat evil forces, find some loot, or save their beloved, questgivers themselves are often the greatest treasure in any game. You see that exclamation mark above their head and get excited to have found someone you can talk to - someone who has a mission for us! A reason to venture forth! See if you can incorporate a quest-giver in your next project, just for fun.

So I've got two questions for you:
Q1) Do you want to be a great game developer?
Q2) Do you think that tons of experience actually doing it would help?

If you answered yes to both those questions, and I'm sure you did, then you belong here. After all, #1GAM is all about encouraging you to regularly practise your art. Making a habit of gamedev, weaving it into your regular daily life; it's the best way to get good at something.

So let's start a new quest right now. A resolution to defeat the boss battle of our insecurities. To level-up our enthusiasm and dev skills by training. Practising. Grinding. Making one simple little practise game per month as a way to get our chops up to our personal highest level and beyond. Up your game by playing it repeatedly.

I mean, that's the goal here, right? To get better at what you aspire to be great at.

Good luck!

As I finish 3rd year of www.onegameamonth.com, I'd also like to give thanks. To you. For bothering to listen to this. For telling your friends about www.onegameamonth.com. I'm so grateful to have you in my adventure party on this awesome mission to improve ourselves.

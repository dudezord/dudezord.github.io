Welcome again to to the second-last month of www.onegameamonth.com year 3! I'm happy to announce that I will be continuing the site for a 4th year in a row, and the motivation to do so is entirely thanks to all the kind words from #1GAM members I've received on twitter, encouraging me to keep running the site. Thank you! Hearing success stories and kind words from you makes it all worthwhile.

This month's optional 250XP theme achievement is: "PROSE"

This month, do more writing than you normally would. Put care into crafting a beautiful backstory, books to read or scrolls to decipher. Code an NPC dialogue engine, or a procedural quest generator that gives verbose descriptions and fancy names to everything.

Invest development time into TEXT COPY. Join #nanowrimo if you need help fighting writer's block. Choose a genre you think is best with lots of text to read; it doesn't have to be IF or a VN, nor does it have to be an RPG; even a puzzle, racing, or platformer game with lots of prose could be really cool if done right. Focus on plot, characters, poetry, conversation, lyrics and incantations. Focus on prose - the written word.

So write a story this month. Create LORE.

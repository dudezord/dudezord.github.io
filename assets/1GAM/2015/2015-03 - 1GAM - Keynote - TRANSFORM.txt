Welcome to month 27 of www.onegameamonth.com - the new 250XP theme achievement is

TRANSFORM.

This month, implement a transformation of some kind.

In yourself, or your game. Shift position on your pet project. Pivot your plans. Adjust your orientation - look in different directions than you're used to. Change scale - go really small or super huge.

Maybe a bouncing star will transform your game's character into a new form. A mushroom could magically alter your scale. The full moon or a magic ring could make you change shape. Maybe the actions of your game's protagonist will transform the world for the better - or worse.

Now getting into the habit of regular gamedev also transforms yourself.

Take the example of a pottery teacher who split the class into two groups. One half would be solely graded on quantity of work, the other half only on the quality of a single piece.

At the end of the experiment, a strange thing happened. I quote:

"The works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the "quantity" group was busy churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay."
-(from the book "Art & Fear")

So transform the clay; your imagination, your code, your design; into something finished. Get fired up and sculpt something small and imperfect. Learn. Get stronger. Repeat.

This will transform your gamedev skills, your confidence, and your experience. It will transform you from a talker - a dreamer - a planner - an innocent-looking sports car, into a powerful, heavily armed gamedev fighting machine ready to save the world from the onslaught of grandiose unfinished projects.

Good luck this month and have fun.

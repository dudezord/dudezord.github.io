What do you see, when you look up at a cloud in the sky? That's this month's onegameamonth.com challenge.

Before designing your game, do this for real - actually look at real clouds in the sky. You might have to wait a few minutes for your busy mind to calm down, or for the wind to sculpt something that gives you ideas.

The shape you imagine could be your main character. Maybe it's a building and the cloud is their base, island, or it's the shape of their space station, ship, or castle.

Perhaps the cloud makes you think of a feeling more than an object, of fading memories or the fog of war, of heroes and omens.

Maybe you should put a cloud right into your game. Whether you fly through them, store you data on them, bounce your characters off them, or inhale them deeply, allow your imagination to incorporate the optional theme word of
CLOUDS for this month's 250xp theme word achievement.

Good luck and have fun!

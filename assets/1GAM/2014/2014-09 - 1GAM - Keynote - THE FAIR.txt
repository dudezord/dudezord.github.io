Late summer is a time when we love to have one last adventure while it's warm. Country fairs pop up around the edges of town. Carnivals, street parties, and farmer's markets appear in parking lots. Day trips to places where warm weather is needed are planned; one last trip to the water park, or a big family roadtrip to go to a huge amusement park.

This month's optional www.onegameamonth.com theme is "the fair".

Think of all the gameplay possibilities that a carnival or fair bring. Think amusement park rides. Rollercoasters and fast movement on rails works for everything from mobile one-touch games to physics puzzlers.

Bumper cars or demolition derbies are a fresh way to use your racing game engine. Water slides and mini-golf seem to go hand in hand and open up more genres for you to choose from.

Imagine the midway at night; music, food and flashing coloured lights. Rides that spin you, games the challenge you, prizes to be won. The carnival, with shooting ranges, strength tests, and games of chance intermingle with arcades, haunted houses and the hall of mirrors.

Make a game with speed and thrills, throw in a loop-the-loop, or put your players in a hollow log and launch them down a waterfall. Hold on tight and keep your arms in the train at all times. Let them spin and crash, take chances and go for a ride. Inflate a huge bouncy castle and let people bounce around a world made of trampolines. Launch players in the air, or make them wander amongst dark traincar alleys among the freaks and lovers.

Go for a trip to the country fair or an amusement park. Ride the midway rides. Explore a carnival. Play the games, and light up the night with the sounds of summer, before the leaves fall to the ground and school begins again. Candyfloss and tiny donuts in hand, sit back and watch the coaster's neon lights light up the night sky.

Good luck, and have fun!

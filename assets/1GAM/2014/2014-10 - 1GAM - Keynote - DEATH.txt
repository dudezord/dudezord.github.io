The leaves are turning red. The nights are growing cold. Harvests are in, and the first hints at harder times ahead start to appear. As the sun grows more distant every day, winter approaches. Darkness descends upon the world. It's coming for all of us.

The optional October 2014 onegameamonth.com theme word is:

DEATH.

Death comes in many forms. The grim reaper, the tides of war, or time itself. The ever-present decay of all living things, as natural as the seasons themselves, still evokes fear in us. We can't avoid it, and we make games to fill our lives with joy and wonder in an attempt to make the best of what little time we have.

This month, with death in your mind, design a game about autumn harvesting, winter rations, survival, regret, or of a time long past. Cover your levels in the dust of centuries, or fill it with the undead. Evoke ghostly visions or rescue those in danger. Bring someone back to life, or cure an epidemic. Tell a story about rebirth, about memories, or about what lies beyond our mortal existence. Give your characters more history, make them older, wiser, closer... to the inevitable.

Good luck, and happy halloween!

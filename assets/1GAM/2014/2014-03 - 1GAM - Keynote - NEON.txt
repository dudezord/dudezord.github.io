Welcome to the 15th edition of www.onegameamonth.com

The optional theme word for this month, in support of the Cyberpunk Game Jam, is NEON. Think glow in the dark. Bloom shaders. Multiply blend effects. Particles. Global Illumination. Darkness pieced by laser beams in cyberspace. Flying electrons. Abstract shapes...

The reason NEON is so fun is that you are free to play with light. With shadow. With colour. Set your game in a dark world lit by a neon glow. Phosporescent lines. Tron light Cycles. Blade Runner Cityscapes. Akira. Shadowrun. Frozen Synapse. Geometry Wars. Your characters could be hacker AI net-runners who wear mirror shades and fight megacorporations. Flying around in a dark virtual reality, as if film noir was seared by a blowtorch.

This month, use tubes of glowing light. Beams and electrons. Have fun, and let your NEON glow shine!

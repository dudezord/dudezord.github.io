This is the 20th keynote for www.onegameamonth.com - thanks so much everyone, for making running the site a labour of love well worth it, still completely uncommercial with no ads or anything.

This month's optional theme word is: FIRE!

So twist and burn, baby, and ignite your gamedev passion. Add tons of smoke, flames, lava, sparks and steam to your game. Make things glow. Make things melt. Make your game red hot.

Ready? Aim? FIRE is your burning desire this month. Whether from a dragon's roar or a spellbook, from a tinder-dry forest floor to a marshmallow, from a flamethrower to a flame of passionate emotion, add some heat.

You don't need to take the word literally. What if your game starred a group of hackers who get back at their employer for being FIRED? Fire a barrage of insults in a witty Twine about trashtalking. Political intrigue may cause a flashpoint on the world stage. Imagine a dark dungeon and only one torch left. Make a game where the main characer is a firefly.

Fight fires... or set them! Explosions... or candles! Burning love... or burning rubber!

Incorporate the word FIRE into your game if it sounds like fun to you.

Because that's the goal of #1GAM - for you to have fun while
exercising your gamedev muscles regularly. So turn the workout into a game or a sport, relax and burn the midnight oil working on your next hot release.

Good luck!

Hi, this is McFunkypants. Thanks for being part of the 24th edition of #1GAM!

This month's optional theme is: SNOW DAY!

School's been cancelled, nobody's showing up at work, the internet is down, there are no cars on the road. It's a bright, sunny, crisp cold day and the world is covered in a pristine blanket of freshly fallen show. Embrace your inner child and think, "nothing to do but go outside and PLAY!"

Make snow angels, catch snowflakes on your tongue, or organize an epic snowball fight with the kids across the street. Build a snow fort, or take your sled to that huge hill and go tobogganing all day.

This month you deserve to take it easy, so feel free to do somthing small and fun like take one of your old games and make a "snowy" winterized holiday edition by changing the art. Fill your game with snowflake particles. Think like a kid and play in the snow.

Joining one game jam a month and making a game over a weekend is a great way to grow your gamedev muscles over time. Like gym memberships, each month fewer and fewer people have stuck with it and gotten in shape. For those of you who made it this far, I salute you.

Keep on learning! Keep on getting better at what you aspire to do by actually DOING IT. It works. Think of your very first painting compared to what you could paint today. Same thing holds true with making games.

Thanks again, everyone, for growing www.onegameamonth.com so consistently. We've pretty much become a "game jam enthusiasts club" and I'm amazed at how many people have shared wisdom and success stories with me, and how much fun it's been! I've no intention of stopping and I hope you don't either. Please tell your friends to join up in January, will you? We're almost at ten thousand people, and we've already raised $500 for charity.

You are awesome, and I'm grateful to be part of this community.

Happy holidays folks. See you in 2015.

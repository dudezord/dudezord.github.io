Welcome to the April 2014 edition of www.onegameamonth.com

Not everyone starts doing one game a month in January, but that's when the majority sign up, probably because of new year's resolutions. Just like a fitness club. If you've been making games monthly for a few months now, guess what: you just broke through the wall of early new year's resolution breakers.

Congratulations, you are one of the many hardcore gamedevs who have gotten into the career-enhancing "habit" of regular gamedev, in the same way that the hardcore athletes who go to the gym all 12 months of the year are generally the ones who go pro. Same holds true in the games industry. Keep showing up.

The optional theme word for the April 2014 #1GAM is WATER.

The life force of nature is water. The need for it is shared by almost every single living thing.

This month, add a splash of wet fun to your game. Making a platformer? Do an underwater level. A strategy game? Troops need water supplies. An RPG? The treasure chest is behind a waterfall, isn't it? A shooter? Don't you mean a firefighting game? Make a swimming game. A sailing game. A surfing game. A farming game. A fishing game. The possibilities are endless.

When designing levels, think of all the forms water can take. Make your levels really foggy. Add steam rising from a morning field with the grass covered in dewdrops. Sculpt beautiful clouds and sunsets, or make the next mission set on a beach, or on a raging river.

This month, dive in. Get wet. Add a splash of water to your game.

This month's optional theme is: ANTHROPOMORPHISM

Embrace your inner furrball and make your animals walk and talk. Pixar up the place, and Disnify nature to your heart's content.

What could be more fun than giving your pets human characteristics? A purr can mean thank you, a bark can be a hello, and a squeak is certainly some sort of top secret warning. Let the trees tell tales of the ancient times, make the rocks cackle at the ocean's roar. Design a racecar that trash-talks before the race, or a violin that longs for adventure.

So this month, give your game characters ears and tails. Each cloud in the sky or bush on the ground might as well have eyes. If it's cute, furry, four-legged, or feathered, give it a nice set of clothes and a spiffy hat.

In these dog days of summer, making games is the cat's pyjamas! So tell tails of hare-raising adventure.

Good luck, nature-lovers!

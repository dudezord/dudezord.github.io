This month's #1GAM theme word is: HARVEST

Today the sun shines warm on your back, but a chill in the wind reminds you that a cold winter approaches.

Gather your supplies, prepare for change, but don't forget to enjoy the fruits of your labour. The time to celebrate and feel grateful has come, but only once the work is done.

This month, try writing a game about farming, about fall, about the lifecycle of a leaf, or planetary exploration. You could explore risk and reward, life and death, reaping what you sow, or collecting information.

Good luck and have fun!

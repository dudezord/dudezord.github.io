Thank you for joining us in the 50th www.onegameamonth.com challenge.

There's revolution in the air. Resistence. Rebellion. The music of change is all around us! What an amazing time for PUNK music to inspire change. For FOLK music to remind us of our hearts. For METAL music to fight our anger, BLUES to ease our sorrow, and DANCE music can heal all wounds.

Music defines a cultural moment, and music also affects gameplay.

This month's 250xp theme word achievement is: ANTHEM

Make a game about countries and borders, or social upheaval. Embrace the punk mentality and smash the state and stick it to the man. Drop out and join the party and pump up your favourite jams like there's no tomorrow. Embrace your dreams and memories and give peace a chance with a crowd chating songs of peace, or turn it to eleven and burn the city down in a heavy metal armageddon.

Try choosing some MUSIC FIRST, and then make a game about how it makes you feel. While developing, let that song play and it will influence your design decisions. Let the music affect your game's pacing and vibe. Let music fill your game, affect your decisions, and change your heart.

Get the crowd chanting, or try to make some small difference in the world. Craft an anthem for the masses or a poem for our age. Join the drum circle or beat the drums of war. Start marching, start moshing, start dancing, or start jamming, and create a game about how you FEEL, you wonderful punks you.

So this month, make your game about a song. Make this song the theme, the melody, the anthem of the world you hope to see in the future.

Never give up, never back down, and turn up the volume!

Good luck!

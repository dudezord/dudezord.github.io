The theme word for month 58 of www.onegameamonth.com is:

DARKNESS.

Are you afraid of the dark? This month, venture into the unknown. Where your senses fail you. Crawl though the pitch black in search of light, or avoid it and stay hidden. Embrace the darkness within yourself; the dark thoughts, the dark places. Explore them. Where echoes hint of things unseen. Dangers await you in the darkness, but so do treasures... and pure power. Do you have the courage to seek the source of your own darkness? Or will you build a way to stave off the night? The choice is yours. Good luck this month, and remember: stick to the shadows if you don't want to get caught.

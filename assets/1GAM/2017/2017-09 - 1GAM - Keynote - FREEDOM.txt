The theme word for month 57 of www.onegameamonth.com is:

FREEDOM.

Shout the word out loud and rush into battle. Let go, be free, and run wild. Smash the shackles that bind you and choose your own adventure!

This month, give the player freedom. The freedom of choice, of movement, of alignment. Stop implementing so many rules and let people wander, wonder, get lost, or do nothing at all.

Stop telling the player what to do! Relinquish the need for quests and objectives, linear paths and invisible walls.

Go past the edge of the map. Free the slaves in the lava mines. Lead a rebellion if need be but the time has come to break free from rule and oppression, and allow yourself to do what you want without restriction or rules or commitments or contracts or logins or time limits.

Celebrate freedom. Get out of bed and go somewhere of your choosing.

What will you do with this newfound freedom?

Will you build? Or destroy?

Will you help? Or hide?

Do what you want.

Embrace freedom.

Welcome to month 45 of www.onegameamonth.com - your friendly neighbourhood game jam enthusiast's club and gamedev bootcamp challenge. You can join anytime and there's aren't any rules. Make games, not excuses. Get better at your craft by neverending practise.

This month's optional 250xp theme word is: INK.

Throw splashes of pigment on a page. Scribble and sketch. Outline and paint. Hand-draw your visual novel's art, code some 3d toon shaders, or make a kung-fu game about magic tattoos. Write scrawled tomes full of secret knowledge, or jot down incantations on a scroll. Sign a contract in blood, or prove what's mightier than the sword. This month, use the word INK to inspire your imagination.

Pick up your quills, your markers, your pens, your needles, or your octopi, and lay down some ink for all to enjoy. Good luck!

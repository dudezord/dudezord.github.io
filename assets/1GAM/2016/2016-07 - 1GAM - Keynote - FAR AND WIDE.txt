Welcome to the summer holiday 2016 edition of www.onegameamonth.com - I am updating the site LIVE on the server from grandma's house, on a less-than-ideal computer, so wish me luck! =)

This month's optional 250xp theme achievement is: FAR AND WIDE

Whether you are celebrating your country this week, visiting relatives, or adventuring around the world, physically or digitally, imagine the vast expanses between where you are now and the opposite shore of whatever island or continent you're on. Allow your imagination to voyage far and wide, from sea to shining sea, across mountains and over plains, above cities and through the clouds.

This month, design a game that involves travel across vast distances. Take your players on a road trip, or give them a vacation. Send them on a distant mission to exotic lands. Ask them to explore far and wide, whether literally through movement, or metaphorically, in their minds. Soar across the landscapes within your imagination.

Good luck, and happy travels!

Thanks for joining the fun of onegameamonth.com - this month's optional 250xp achievement theme word is: ARENA!

Whatever kind of game you'd like to make can be framed within the context of an arena. You could make an rpg collisseum, a local multiplayer brawler, a twin-stick bullet hell, a game with nothing but boss battles, a reality-tv show, a ninja movie simulator, a 3d puzzler, a racing game, a debate simulator... you name it!

Just put the action into an enclosed space; a single room, a stage, a court, a pit, a track, a complex, a dojo, a course, a ring. Design one big echo-filled space, perhaps with room for an audience and loudspeakers for an announcer. There's no exit - this isn't a maze of corridoors. This is an arena. It does not have to be all about battle - you could create a sports arena, a playground, or any kinds of challenge in an enclosed space that you can imagine.

Get your game feel - the movement, the action, the moment-to-moment gameplay - so tight, so polished, that you don't need a huge streaming free-roam open world to explore. All the action occurs is a single space that you refine to perfection.

A single arena. A place to test yourself. To compete. To train. The practise your skills, to play a game with friends or foes, to earn a top place on the leaderboard, or simply survive for as long as you can.

Now get ready to rumble! 3... 2... 1... FIGHT

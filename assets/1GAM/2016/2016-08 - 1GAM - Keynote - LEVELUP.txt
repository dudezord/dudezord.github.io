Making one game a month is a fun way to get game development experience.
It's all about training your skills and getting better at what you aspire to be great at.
Making games!

This month's optional 250xp theme word is: levelup

Design an experience point system for your next game.
Devise a way to get better at the skills you want players to enjoy.
Implement a skill tree, or a skill point system, or unlocks based on accumulated experience.

Will you reward players with a juicy popup dialog where three stars explode into fireworks?
Will you activate glowing achievement icons when a threshold is crossed?
Will you let players spin wheels or roll dice for a bonus inventory item?
Will you code a skill tree of new abilities you can unlock in a hierarchy?

Whatever you choose to develop, just remember that in creating
a levelup system for your next game,
you will also be levelling up your real life
game developer skill and earning real life experience points.

Getting better at what you love to do feels great.
Embrace that feeling and start coding. Good luck!

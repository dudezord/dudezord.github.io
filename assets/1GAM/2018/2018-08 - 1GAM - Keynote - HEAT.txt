Welcome to the 68th one game a month challenge.

The optional theme is: HEAT

This month, keep your cool and make a super hot game. Radiate energy, absorb vibrations, or generate excitement. Avoid dangerous rays, reflect beams, or photosynthesize with abandon. Cook something tasty, fry up some fun, or roast something over a fire.

Go supernova, generate friction, or feel the burn... however you choose to embrace the theme word this month, I hope you beat the heat and your game is sweet.

Welcome to #1GAM month 63. Make a game this month just for fun.

This month's optional theme is: PERMANENCE

Perma-death. Perma-frost. Permanent markers. This month, set things in stone. Make it final. There's no going back. If you die, you die. The things you build? They persist. The damage you did never gets erased; the cumulative effects of player input should be felt forevermore.

Challenge yourself to make a game where the player has a lasting impact on things; whether they succeed or fail. Burn a bridge. Smash a wall. Miss an opportunity. Change the world. Whatever you do, this month, make it permanent.

Welcome to the 66th one game a month challenge.

The theme of the month is: CREATURE FEATURE!

Scary or cute, evil or friendly, creatures fill any adventure with personality. This month, make creatures of any shape or size for your game. Anthromorphize all your objects; put eyes on things. Interact with your little critters. Give the player a sidekick, a friendly monster companion, or make the player a creature themselves! Let the denizens of your game world be fantastic, creepy, slimy, bouncy, or spiked. Bring your nightmares to life or construct delightful beasts as part of this month's game development challenge. Add a "creature feature" to your game design, and let the gameplay derive inspiration from it. Good luck!

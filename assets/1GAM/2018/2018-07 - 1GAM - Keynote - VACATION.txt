Welcome to the 67th one game a month challenge.

The theme of the month is: VACATION!

You deserve some rest and recouperation. Set off on an adventure this month. Pack light, but don't forget the essentials. Let your game's characters linger, let them explore, allow them to sight-see.

This month, try putting ice cream, sunshine, hotel rooms, long flights, or road trips into your game designs. Enjoy some poolside treats after hot lazy days. Sleep somewhere new. Get to know a far-off place. Give your players a vacation from their normal routines. Something unfamiliar and restorative.

Welcome to the 71st one game a month challenge!

This month's optional theme, to be used for inspiration is: THANKS

Do you know just how lucky you really are? Can you make a game all about being grateful? About giving thanks, or doing deeds that deserve gratitude? Have you ever received help, encouragement, or attention at just the right time? Have you been given support, money, food, or just the right weapon to protect you when it's dangerous to go alone? Did you remember to give thanks? Now's your chance. Good luck this month, and remember to be thankful for all that you have.

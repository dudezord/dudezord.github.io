Welcome to #1GAM month 62. Can you make a game this month? Join us and prove to yourself that you can.

This month's optional theme is: MUSIC

Make a game about music, whether literally simply influenced by it. Design a game drum beats, about dancing, or about songs of heroic deeds told by bards in taverns. Put musical instruments in your game instead of weapons or tools.

You don't have to make a music or rhythm game; instead you could choose a song and put it on loop while you code the game, letting it's vibe influence your creative decisions. Spend time choosing the background song in your game this time around. The music players hear will have a huge impact on how they feel; it sets the tone for the action.

It is also the February Album Writing Month and RPM Challenge, which encourage everyone to make music all month long!

Join me this month in creating as many songs as you can, or making a game inspired by music. Good luck!

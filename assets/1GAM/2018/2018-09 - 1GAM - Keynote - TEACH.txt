Welcome to the 69th one game a month challenge.

This month's optional theme, to be used for inspiration is: TEACH

This month, focus on educating your players. Use constant feedback to let players know when they're doing the right things. Track skill improvements over time. Rank, rate, and grade their performance, then help them improve. Design a FUN tutorial. Make it simple. Show, don't tell. Keep them engaged. Encouraged. Enthralled with the way your game helps them along.

Teach your players, educate your fans, and level up your design skills! Good luck!

Welcome to the 65th fun month of #1GAM!

The theme of the month is: DEATH.

Games are all about death. You generally die more times than you beat a level. You generally affect the game universe by causing things to die, or trying to save them from death.

The dream of a real life "respawn" is our most basic desire. Who wouldn't want a cat's nine lives?

Legends are full of those who attempt to cheat death, whether vampires or the undead, and they are also full of as many heroes intent on putting them down for good.

This month, focus on six feet under. Realize that you are mortal. Your life is finite. What are you going to do with what little you have left?

I say, MAKE GAMES now! Today! Before it's too late and the grim reaper finally calls your number. It truly could be tomorrow. So don't waste any more time.

If I could, I would stuff your life arcade machine full of quarters and give you as many continues as I could. But you're out of continues. You're out of lives. And there's no such thing as a health potion. Remember this, in the face of certain doom - you're not dead right now. So what are you going to do with this precious gift? Do what you dream about having done!

Make games until you die! GOOD LUCK!

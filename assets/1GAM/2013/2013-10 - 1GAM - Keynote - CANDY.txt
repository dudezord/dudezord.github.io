Welcome to www.onegameamonth.com - October edition.

This month's optional theme word is CANDY. Go for something sweet. Something dripping with chocolate. Make your game a treat for your players. Drizzle it in cherry sauce or rainbow sprinkles. Make your particle systems look like a pinata. Put on a scary mask, grab your pillowcase, and bring home a huge bag full of candy.

This month is the www.ludumdare.com OCTOBER CHALLENGE, in which your quest is to finish a game, take it to market, and earn a dollar.

Oh, and next month, keep an eye out for November's www.charitygamejam.com

Please. With sugar on top! Have fun!

Hi welcome to 1GAM, September edition.

If you're just joining us, welcome!

You can start anytime, and if you only make
one or two games all year we'd still love
to have your game posted on the site.

Remember, #1GAM is for practise games. Tiny
game jam experiments - workouts to strengnthen
your gamedev muscles. We do not demand perfection.

If you've been with me on the crazy journey
since the beginning, I want to humbly thank you.

September's 100% option THEME is:

HEXAGONS

Hexagons and games go hand-in-hand. They evoke
thoughts of strategy, tactics, and mind-candy.

Visually, they tesselate beautifully, like
gemstones or a honeycomb. They aren't just for
strategy games: imagine a platformer with the sprite grid
made up of hexagons: you could have hills and ramps!

In gaming, hexagons are often used in board games
to give maps less of a grid feel. From wargames and
world maps to puzzles and dungeons, the humble hexagon
opens up an infinite variety of visual, mental, and physical
gameplay experiences.

Hexagons aren't just for video and tabletop games:
I hope to see at least one game with a soccerball in it too.

Whatever you do, remember that 1GAM is for FUN.

There are no rules.
Just do what you want.
Make games.

Make something small and simple.

Well, now you have your SEPTEMBER QUEST:

Try to put some hexagons in your game.

Have fun and good luck!

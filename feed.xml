<h2 id="hello-again">Hello, again!</h2>

<p>A week has already passed, so it is time for an official™ update on the development of <strong>Gatekeeper</strong>.</p>

<p>I have been able to work a couple of hours each day on the project and I’m loving it! It has been pretty cool so far to learn Godot as it is pretty beginner-friendly on how to make things.</p>

<p>The first few days I dedicated to go through <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/index.html">some tutorials</a> to learn the basics of Godot.</p>

<p>After I felt I knew the bare minimum to start programming this game, I jumped directly into it.
The first task was to create a placeholder for the most important element of the game… the <strong>Gate</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>

<h3 id="gate-placeholder">Gate placeholder</h3>
<p>I started by mocking up an isometric shape, since I thought it would give more depth and character to the gate than a simple 2D side-view.
I immediatelly put my hands on creating a raise and lower animations that felt somewhat convincing. This was pretty easy to do, thanks to the usage of Ease functions on Godot animations.</p>

<video style="vertical-align: middle;" controls="" loop="" src="/assets/img/blog/posts/01-portcullis/part-2-Gate_Animation.webm"></video>

<p><br />
Afterwards, I decided that the gate would have two collision areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a side one, which would behave like a wall to stop mobs;</li>
  <li>a bottom one, which would behave like the area with spikes that will kill the enemies.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, I ended up with the best gate I have ever made in my life. Behold!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog/posts/01-portcullis/part-2-gate-placeholder.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="mobs-placeholder">Mobs placeholder</h3>

<p>Having extensive experience developing Gate placeholders made creating the mobs placeholder very easy.
Mobs also have two collision areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>one for stopping when they reach the closed gate;</li>
  <li>another for detecting when they are being smashed by the gate.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog/posts/01-portcullis/part-2-mob-placeholder.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="simple-game-loop">Simple game loop</h3>

<p>Now it was finally time to start gluing things together.</p>

<p>I created a basic Spawner script to randomly spawn villagers or enemies.
These would walk automatically towards the Gate, and would either collide with it or pass through.</p>

<p>Collisions use four separate Physics Layers to detect which part of the mob collided with which part of the gate.
Each collision with the gate triggers a separate area_entered() signal, depending if it collided with the side or the bottom part.
A new signal is then emited to the colliding mob, telling them to “stop” or “die”.
If the gate raises then they are no longer colliding, so a “move” signal is emited from the Gate to the mob.</p>

<p>A corresponding Despawner script was also added to make sure the mobs can graciously be terminated once they leave the screen.</p>

<p>You can see it all in action below.</p>

<video controls="" loop="" src="/assets/img/blog/posts/01-portcullis/part-2-Game_Loop.webm"></video>

<p class="note" title="A poem">Villagers are green,<br />
EnemySoliders are red,<br />
don’t walk near a falling gate,<br />
or you will end up dead!</p>

<h2 id="until-next-week">Until next week…</h2>
<p>These are the tasks that I will attempt to work on for the following week:</p>

<h3 id="winning--losing-conditions">Winning / Losing conditions</h3>
<p>Having already a basic game loop, my next task will be implementing the core losing/winning conditions for the game. My current concept is to award points whenever the player kills an enemy or lets a villager through, and deduct points otherwise.</p>

<p>I also though about relating the spawning/movement rate of the mobs and movement speed of the gate with the overall success rate of the player. The better the player, the faster the game gets, the more points are available to earn.</p>

<p>After a set amount of time, the game ends, and the player receives its final score.</p>

<h3 id="game-art">Game art</h3>
<p>Now, this is where my vulnerabilities start. Let me begin by assuring you that I was never good at drawing. I don’t even consider myself mediocre. I consciously avoided any kind of arts and crafts project since I was a kid.</p>

<p>I already got some motivation by watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuR78-IJ9Y">great video</a> of another fellow game developer. Make sure to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jotson">follow</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/yafd">him</a>, because he works on really cool stuff.</p>

</div>

<p><br />
<br />
With that in mind, I’ll give it my absolute best.<br />
I’ll see you again in about a week, with another development update.</p>]]></content><author><name>dudezord</name><email>dudezord@protonmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven’t yet, please read Part 1.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/assets/img/blog/posts/01-portcullis/part-2.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="/assets/img/blog/posts/01-portcullis/part-2.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Making my first game - Portcullis (Part 1)</title><link href="/blog/2022-04-01-making-my-first-game-portcullis-part-1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Making my first game - Portcullis (Part 1)" /><published>2022-04-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-03-31T01:08:17+01:00</updated><id>/blog/making-my-first-game-portcullis-part-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2022-04-01-making-my-first-game-portcullis-part-1/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<h2 id="greetings-fellow-adventurer">Greetings, fellow adventurer!</h2>

<p>The time has come for my first challenge.
As you <a href="/blog/2022-03-02-the-plan-is-simple/" class="external">already know</a>, I will be doing one game a month as a way to learn everything I can about game development.</p>

<p>Starting from now (April 2022), every month I will make a game from start-to-finish based on one of the original themes of <a href="/projects/1GAM">#1GAM</a>.</p>

<p>With that in mind, the theme for this month is… <em>**drum roll**</em></p>

<h2 id="theme---portcullis">Theme - “Portcullis”</h2>

<p>Before we proceed, I suggest you listen to the <a href="/projects/1GAM/#1">original keynote</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/McFunkypants">@McFunkypants</a>.<br />
His words convey all the meaning that I want this blog to have.<br />
For lots of current game developers, their journey started there and then. For me, it (re-)starts now.<br /></p>

<p>With that in mind, let’s begin!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portcullis">Portcullis</a> is the name given to a defensive sliding gate at the entrance of a castle. It is mounted on vertical grooves and can be raised and lowered very rapidly by a single guard. It can be used to prevent the passage of unwanted enemies, or even to trap them between two consecutive portcullises.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="initial-ideas">Initial ideas</h3>
    <p>The first game ideas that came to my mind were:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>“Gatekeeper”</strong> - You guard the main gate of your medieval city. You have to decide who enters and who can leave. Good choices might have good consequences. Bad choices will always prove to be bad.</li>
      <li><strong>“Open the gate!”</strong> - The King and Queen have returned from their long vacation, but it looks like they lost the keys to the Castle. You, as the Official Lockpicker of the Reign, shall open the gate for their Royal Highnesses. But don’t take too long, or you might lose your head.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I decided to go with <strong>“Gatekeeper”</strong> as I was having some issues coming up with puzzles/mechanics for the other title.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="game-concept---gatekeeper">Game Concept - “Gatekeeper”</h2>
<p>In this game, you play the very important role of guarding the entrance to the city.<br />
As a core mechanic, you will have the ability of lowering and raising the Portcullis.</p>

<p>You might allow your citizens to enter, while prohibiting undesired people from doing the same.
When enemies come to attack, you will be able to use the spikes of the falling Portcullis to crush them and prevent their success.</p>

<p>Do a good enough of a job and you will be able to upgrade your abilities in defending the Kingdom.<br />
Do a bad enough of a job and it will be your head on a spike instead!</p>

<p><br />
<br />
Time to finally get my hands dirty and play with <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot</a> for the first time.<br />
I’ll be back next week, with an update on the development of this project. See you soon!</p>]]></content><author><name>dudezord</name><email>dudezord@protonmail.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/assets/img/blog/posts/01-portcullis/part-1.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="/assets/img/blog/posts/01-portcullis/part-1.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The plan is simple</title><link href="/blog/2022-03-02-the-plan-is-simple/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The plan is simple" /><published>2022-03-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-31T01:08:18+01:00</updated><id>/blog/the-plan-is-simple</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2022-03-02-the-plan-is-simple/"><![CDATA[<p class="note">If you haven’t read my <a href="/blog/2022-03-01-a-new-beginning">initial blog post</a>, please check it first!</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="the-plan-is-simple">The plan is simple</h2>

<p>I already have some definitive ideas about what I want to do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All the programming will be done on <a href="https://godotengine.org"><strong>Godot</strong></a>. I only have a little bit of experience using other engines, but since Godot is the <em>“new”</em> cool kid on the block, I decided on it.</li>
  <li>Project ideas will come sequentially from the amazing list of <a href="/projects/1GAM"><strong>#1GAM</strong></a>. I compiled the entire list of themes and keynotes since they aren’t available on the original site anymore.</li>
  <li>On each project, I will focus on improving one or more parts of game development where I don’t feel as confident. This can be anything from planning, writing, coding, art, modelling, music, marketing, setting up a Steam page, etc. 
<br />I only ever did <strong>programming</strong> since 2008, so the opportunities to learn the remaining stuff are endless.</li>
  <li>Regarding <em>deadlines</em>, I intend to honor the <a href="/projects/1GAM"><strong>#1GAM</strong></a> motto - one game a month.</li>
  <li>Document everything! This is a learning experiment, both for you and me. Even a website/blog is something I never did in the past. We are already making progress! 😄</li>
  <li>… and most important, <strong>ENJOY</strong> the journey!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="or-is-it">Or is it?</h2>

<p>I still don’t know what software I’ll use for practicing all the other stuff. I also don’t know how frequently I should write updates on my progress.
<br />
I’ll gladly take suggestions from the audience.</p>

<h2 id="ready-set">Ready? Set…</h2>
<p>I guess we will have to see how it goes!</p>]]></content><author><name>dudezord</name><email>dudezord@protonmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven’t read my initial blog post, please check it first!]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/assets/img/blog/posts/solo-developers.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="/assets/img/blog/posts/solo-developers.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">A new beginning</title><link href="/blog/2022-03-01-a-new-beginning/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A new beginning" /><published>2022-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-31T01:08:19+01:00</updated><id>/blog/a-new-beginning</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2022-03-01-a-new-beginning/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<h2 id="hello-everyone">Hello everyone!</h2>
<p><br />
My real name is Pedro and I was born in the beautiful and sunny 🇵🇹 Portugal.
<br />
Since I was a young child that I had the desire to one day become a Game Developer.</p>

<p>At 18 years of age, I started to pursue my dream and enrolled in a Computer Science degree.
<br />
At 26 years of age, I finished my MSc in Graphics Programming and Game Development.</p>

<p>I was ready. The World was ready. The time had come. Right? <em>Right…?!?!</em></p>

<p>5 years have already passed and the answer is: <strong>WRONG</strong>!</p>

<p>I was never able to work on games professionally.
<br />
And because of that I also never had the motivation to work on them on my free time.</p>

<p>The time has finally come… The journey starts now!</p>]]></content><author><name>dudezord</name><email>dudezord@protonmail.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/assets/img/blog/posts/press-start.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="/assets/img/blog/posts/press-start.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>

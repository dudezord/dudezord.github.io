<h2 id="or-is-it">Or is it?</h2>

<p>I still don‚Äôt know what software I‚Äôll use for practicing all the other stuff. I also don‚Äôt know how frequently I should write updates on my progress.
<br />
I‚Äôll gladly take suggestions from the audience.</p>

<h2 id="ready-set-go">Ready? Set‚Ä¶ Go!</h2>
<p>I guess we will have to see how it goes!</p>]]></content><author><name>dudezord</name><email>dudezord@protonmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I already have some definitive ideas about what I want to do: All the programming will be done on Godot.

<br />
My real name is Pedro and I was born in the beautiful and sunny üáµüáπ Portugal.
<br />
Since I was a young child that I had the desire to one day become a Game Developer.</p>

<p>At 18 years of age, I started to pursue my dream and enrolled in a Computer Science degree.
<br />
At 26 years of age, I finished my MSc in Graphics Programming and Game Development.</p>

<p>I was ready. The World was ready. The time had come. Right? <em>Right‚Ä¶?!?!</em></p>

<p>5 years have already passed and the answer is: <strong>WRONG</strong>!</p>

<p>I was never able to work on games professionally.
<br />
And because of that I also never had the motivation to work on them on my free time.</p>

<p>The time has finally come‚Ä¶ The journey starts now!</p>]]></content><author><name>dudezord</name><email>dudezord@protonmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!

<h2 id="the-plan-is-simple">The plan is simple</h2>

<p>I already have some definitive ideas about what I want to do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All the programming will be done on <a href="https://godotengine.org"><strong>Godot</strong></a>. I only have a little bit of experience using other engines, but since Godot is the <em>‚Äúnew‚Äù</em> cool kid on the block, I decided on it.</li>
  <li>Project ideas will come sequentially from the amazing list of <a href="/projects/1GAM"><strong>#1GAM</strong></a>. I compiled the entire list of themes and keynotes since they aren‚Äôt available on the original site anymore.</li>
  <li>On each project, I will focus on improving one or more parts of game development where I don‚Äôt feel as confident. This can be anything from planning, writing, coding, art, modelling, music, marketing, setting up a Steam page, etc. 
<br />I only ever did <strong>programming</strong> since 2008, so the opportunities to learn the remaining stuff are endless.</li>
  <li>Regarding <em>deadlines</em>, I intend to honor the <a href="/projects/1GAM"><strong>#1GAM</strong></a> motto - one game a month.</li>
  <li>Document everything! This is a learning experiment, both for you and me. Even a website/blog is something I never did in the past. We are already making progress! üòÑ</li>
  <li>‚Ä¶ and most important, <strong>ENJOY</strong> the journey!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="or-is-it">Or is it?</h2>

<p>I still don‚Äôt know what software I‚Äôll use for practicing all the other stuff. I also don‚Äôt know how frequently I should write updates on my progress.
<br />
I‚Äôll gladly take suggestions from the audience.</p>

<h2 id="ready-set">Ready? Set‚Ä¶</h2>
<p>I guess we will have to see how it goes!</p>]]></content><author><name>dudezord</name><email>dudezord@protonmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven‚Äôt read my initial blog post, please check it first!]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/assets/img/blog/solo-developers.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="/assets/img/blog/solo-developers.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">A new beginning</title><link href="/blog/2022-03-01-a-new-beginning/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A new beginning" /><published>2022-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-23T21:54:13+00:00</updated><id>/blog/a-new-beginning</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2022-03-01-a-new-beginning/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<h2 id="hello-everyone">Hello everyone!</h2>
<p><br />
My real name is Pedro and I was born in the beautiful and sunny üáµüáπ Portugal.
<br />
Since I was a young child that I had the desire to one day become a Game Developer.</p>

<p>At 18 years of age, I started to pursue my dream and enrolled in a Computer Science degree.
<br />
At 26 years of age, I finished my MSc in Graphics Programming and Game Development.</p>

<p>I was ready. The World was ready. The time had come. Right? <em>Right‚Ä¶?!?!</em></p>

<p>5 years have already passed and the answer is: <strong>WRONG</strong>!</p>

<p>I was never able to work on games professionally.
<br />
And because of that I also never had the motivation to work on them on my free time.</p>

<p>The time has finally come‚Ä¶ The journey starts now!</p>]]></content><author><name>dudezord</name><email>dudezord@protonmail.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/assets/img/blog/press-start.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="/assets/img/blog/press-start.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
